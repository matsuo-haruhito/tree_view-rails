# Changelog

This changelog uses the following categories when applicable:

- `Added` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing behavior.
- `Fixed` for bug fixes.
- `Deprecated` for features planned for removal.
- `Removed` for removed features.
- `Security` for vulnerability fixes and security hardening notes.
- `Documentation` for docs-only changes.
- `Tests` for test, CI, and package verification changes.

Breaking changes and required migration notes should be called out explicitly in the relevant version section.

## Unreleased

Release preparation notes:

- Treat `Added`, `Changed`, and `Fixed` entries as the primary reader-facing release notes. Many entries in this section expand public configuration, helper, JavaScript, or manifest-backed surfaces and should stay visible to host-app maintainers.
- Keep `Documentation` and `Tests` entries available as release evidence, but summarize or group them during the release preparation PR when they are maintenance-only and do not change runtime behavior.
- Record public API manifest, package-root export, and documented hook changes by their user-visible effect. Use `Documentation` only when docs or manifest guidance changed without a runtime or compatibility-surface change.
- No breaking change, deprecation, or removal is currently called out in `Unreleased`. If a later release review identifies one, add the migration note before moving these entries into a dated version section.

### Added

- Added localized display-name helpers for model, attribute, and node type names through ActiveModel / I18n.
- Added `UiConfig#turbo_frame` and `UiConfigBuilder#build_turbo(turbo_frame:)` so Turbo toggle links can target a host-app Turbo Frame without custom JavaScript.
- Added `tree_view_toolbar(render_state)` for rendering tree-wide expand/collapse toolbar actions through `UiConfig#toggle_all_path`.
- Added `TreeView::NodePresenter` as a thin adapter for node-level resolver hooks and `RenderState` row class/data/icon/badge builders.
- Added owner model argument support to the persisted state install generator so `tree_view:state:install User` can include `TreeViewStateOwner` in an existing owner model.
- Added `TreeView::StateStore#clear!` so host apps can clear saved expansion state for an owner and tree instance key.
- Added `TreeView::StateStore#clear_owner!` so host apps can clear all saved expansion state records for one owner while keeping per-tree-instance clear behavior separate.
- Added `RenderState` current node ancestor expansion via `current_item` / `current_key` and `auto_expand_ancestors`.
- Added `TreeView::PathTreeBuilder` for building generated folder nodes and record nodes from path-like record values.
- Added `TreeView.configuration.render_log_level`, defaulting to `:warn`, so TreeView helper-rendered partial logs can be silenced without changing the host app's global Rails logger level.
- Added a public TreeView-specific error hierarchy rooted at `TreeView::Error` for rescuing validation and configuration failures.
- Added explicit `UiConfig#mode` values for `:turbo`, `:static`, and `:client`, plus `UiConfigBuilder#build_turbo` and `UiConfigBuilder#build_client_side`.
- Added client-side-only expand/collapse mode that renders collapsed descendants into initial HTML and toggles rows in the browser with the bundled `tree-view-client` controller.
- Added `TreeView::Diagnostics.run` as a consolidated diagnostics entrypoint for node keys, DOM IDs, orphans, and cycles.
- Added `tree_children_container_dom_id`, `tree_remote_state_placeholder_dom_id`, and `tree_remote_state_placeholder_attributes` so host apps can reuse stable lazy-loading placeholder IDs and data attributes.
- Added `TreeViewEventDetailKeys` as a package-root JavaScript export for host app tests that need machine-readable documented event detail key names.
- Added `TreeViewTransferDataAttributes` as a package-root JavaScript export for documented transfer payload and disabled-row data attributes.
- Added `toggle_icons` to the manifest-backed grouped option compatibility surface while keeping the existing RenderState option behavior unchanged.

### Changed

- Removed misleading `aria-controls` from Turbo toggle links until TreeView has a single stable controlled target.
- Clarified public builder naming decisions: prefer `badge_builder`, keep `icon_builder` as a compatibility alias, treat `row_event_payload_builder` as transfer-specific, and document `loading_builder` / `error_builder` as boolean predicates.
- Strengthened pull request CI to run Ruby specs alongside Standard Ruby lint while keeping broader compatibility and release checks on `main`.
- Split RenderState selection and lazy-loading normalization into internal configuration objects while keeping the public RenderState API compatible.
- Remote-state retry actions now mark the row `loading` and dispatch `tree-view-remote-state:change` before the existing retry event, so host app listeners can observe the loading transition consistently.

### Fixed

- Cleaned up generated selection hidden inputs when selection controllers disconnect, scoped to each controller source id.

- Clarified Release docs for the Ruby support source guard and release checklist relationship across README, gemspec, CI workflow, Dockerfile Ruby base image, Development docs, and package script sources.
- Clarified that RenderState current-branch examples should prefer `current_item` / `current_key` with `auto_expand_ancestors` when only the current path should start open.
- Clarified that RenderWindow and windowed rendering limit HTML output only, while Lazy Loading, Children Pagination, and host-app virtual scrolling handle data-loading and DOM-virtualization concerns.
