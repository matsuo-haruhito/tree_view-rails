# Release note candidate collector

`script/release_note_candidates.rb` is a release preparation helper for collecting links that a maintainer may want to review before writing GitHub Release notes.

It is intentionally a candidate collector only:

- It does not edit `CHANGELOG.md`.
- It does not decide the final release notes.
- It does not tag, publish, or create a GitHub Release.
- It does not replace the release preparation PR described in `docs/en/release.md`.

## Date window

Use a date window when you want GitHub Search to return merged pull requests and closed issues directly:

```bash
ruby script/release_note_candidates.rb --repo matsuo-haruhito/tree_view-rails --since 2026-06-01
```

This mode queries:

- merged pull requests with `merged:>=YYYY-MM-DD`
- closed issues with `closed:>=YYYY-MM-DD`

Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` when you need a higher API rate limit or private repository access. Public repositories can usually be checked without a token, subject to GitHub API limits.

## Since tag

Use a tag when you want a local release review based on commit references after the previous release tag:

```bash
ruby script/release_note_candidates.rb --repo matsuo-haruhito/tree_view-rails --since-tag v0.1.0
```

This mode compares the tag to `HEAD`, extracts `#123` style references from commit messages, and resolves those numbers as pull requests or issues. It is useful as a fallback when a date window is not obvious, but it only finds references that appear in commit messages.

## Output example

The script prints Markdown that is meant to be copied into release preparation notes, not committed as the final release text:

```markdown
# Release note candidates for matsuo-haruhito/tree_view-rails

Source: closed or merged since 2026-06-01

This is a maintainer review aid. It does not rewrite CHANGELOG.md and does not decide the final release notes.

During the release preparation PR, paste or link this output as review evidence, then compare it with `CHANGELOG.md`, the merged PR history, and any release-facing compatibility notes. Keep only the human-approved highlights in GitHub Release notes.

## Review boundary

Treat the output as a checklist for maintainer review. During the release preparation PR, compare it with `CHANGELOG.md` and the merged PR history, then manually decide which items are notable enough for GitHub Release notes.
