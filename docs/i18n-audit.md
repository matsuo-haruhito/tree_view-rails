# Documentation maintenance checklist

This page is the long-lived documentation maintenance checklist for `tree_view`.

The path stays at `docs/i18n-audit.md` so existing links keep working, but the document is no longer a pre-`0.1.0` release tracker. Use it as an ongoing checklist when public docs, language-specific docs, release docs, or compatibility guidance change.

## Current structure

Documentation is organized around language-specific directories.

- `docs/README.md`: documentation language selector and maintenance entry point
- `docs/ja/`: Japanese documentation tree
- `docs/en/`: English documentation tree
- `docs/mockups/`: technical mockup assets
- `docs/i18n-audit.md`: documentation maintenance checklist

Root-level prose docs should stay limited to intentional entry points, maintenance notes, or technical assets. Canonical prose docs belong under `docs/ja/` and `docs/en/`.

## Page-level language coverage and translation priority

Use this table when you need a quick answer to "which user-facing pages must stay aligned first?".

Japanese remains the more complete canonical prose source when English wording lags, but the pages below are the current cross-language planning baseline promised by `docs/en/README.md`, `docs/ja/README.md`, and `docs/README.md`.

| Docs lane | Current coverage status | Priority | Maintenance expectation |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/README.md`, `docs/en/README.md`, `docs/ja/README.md` | Published entry points for cross-language navigation and language-status guidance | High | Update in the same docs lane whenever reading order, docs map, or language-status promises change |
| `docs/en/installation.md`, `docs/ja/installation.md` | Published in both trees | High | Keep setup, asset, importmap, and first-run instructions aligned before release-facing docs changes land |
| `docs/en/minimal-usage.md`, `docs/ja/minimal-usage.md` | Published in both trees | High | Keep the first working host-app example aligned with installation and usage docs |
| `docs/en/usage.md`, `docs/ja/usage.md` | Published in both trees | High | Keep the baseline user-facing behavior and responsibility guidance aligned |
| `docs/en/api-overview.md`, `docs/ja/api-overview.md` | Published in both trees | High | Keep the first API-orientation page aligned when public entry points or recommended reading order change |
| `docs/en/decision-guide.md`, `docs/ja/decision-guide.md` | Published in both trees | Follow-up | Revisit when API selection guidance or responsibility boundaries change materially |
| `docs/en/faq.md`, `docs/ja/faq.md` and `docs/en/troubleshooting.md`, `docs/ja/troubleshooting.md` | Published in both trees | Follow-up | Revisit when common integration misunderstandings, symptoms, or rescue paths change |
| `docs/en/public-api.md`, `docs/ja/public-api.md`, `docs/en/api.md`, `docs/ja/api.md`, `docs/en/js-events.md`, `docs/ja/js-events.md` | Published in both trees | Follow-up | Revisit in the same PR when public API wording, compatibility promises, or machine-readable public contract surfaces change |
| Feature guides such as `resource-table-bridge.md`, `form-editing.md`, `selection.md`, `lazy-loading.md`, `windowed-rendering.md`, and `persisted-state.md` under both language trees | Published in both trees, but English detail can lag behind Japanese | Follow-up | Revisit when the related feature meaning, host-app responsibility boundary, or recommended pattern changes materially |
| Release-facing and maintainer-facing guides such as `release.md`, `migration.md`, `development.md`, `design-policy.md`, and `code-quality.md` under both language trees | Published in both trees | Follow-up | Revisit when release expectations, compatibility policy, CI workflow, or maintainer rules change |

If a page outside the High lane changes first, do not block the docs PR automatically. Instead, leave a visible note in the changed page or PR and add the follow-up to the next bilingual maintenance sweep.

## Page-set parity checks

Use the page-set check as a lightweight inventory guard before adding, renaming, or removing prose docs under `docs/en/` or `docs/ja/`. The baseline expectation is that user-facing Markdown pages in those two language trees have a matching peer with the same filename.

Exceptions are allowed when the mismatch is intentional and visible:

- root-level maintenance assets such as this checklist, `docs/README.md`, and technical asset indexes stay outside the language-tree parity set
- `docs/mockups/**` is a technical visual reference area and is tracked through its own README, review gallery, and browser smoke inventory instead of language-tree parity
- a page may temporarily exist in one language first when the PR or changed page leaves a visible follow-up note and does not change the High-lane entry-point promise

Only add a parity exception when the mismatch is temporary, maintainer-only, or a technical asset that is intentionally outside user-facing prose coverage. Record the exception in `script/test_docs_i18n_parity.mjs` with a key in the form `sourceLanguage:relative-page.md`, where `sourceLanguage` is the language tree that currently has the page. Each exception must include non-empty `affectedLanguage`, `reason`, and `review` metadata so the missing peer language, the reason for the mismatch, and the planned review timing or removal condition stay visible in the check itself. Do not use exceptions to make one-language user-facing docs permanent; if a user-facing page must stay unmatched for more than one maintenance sweep, track the follow-up explicitly and revisit whether the docs map still promises the right coverage.

When a lightweight automated parity check exists, use it as a first pass only. It should flag missing peer filenames and validate documented exception metadata; it should not judge translation quality, wording equivalence, or whether Japanese or English is the canonical prose source for a disputed behavior.

## When to update both Japanese and English docs

Update both language trees when the change affects user-facing behavior, public options, responsibility boundaries, or guidance that a reader would reasonably expect to match across languages.

Typical triggers:

- public API additions, removals, or compatibility notes
- installation, importmap, JavaScript entrypoint, or asset setup changes
- accessibility semantics, keyboard behavior, or ARIA responsibility changes
- decision-guide recommendations or documented host-app responsibility boundaries
- cookbook, lazy-loading, persisted-state, render-scale, or other feature guidance that changed meaningfully
- migration, deprecation, or release-note guidance for shared public surfaces

If one language must temporarily lag, leave a short note in the changed doc or PR so the mismatch is visible and easy to follow up.

## Update matrix

| Change type | Update these docs |
|---|---|
| Public API, helper entrypoints, option names, compatibility promises, or machine-readable public contract surfaces | `config/public_api_manifest.yml` when it is the machine-readable source of truth, `docs/ja/api.md`, `docs/en/api.md`, `docs/ja/public-api.md`, `docs/en/public-api.md`, and related feature docs |
| Accessibility semantics or interaction behavior | `docs/ja/accessibility-semantics.md`, `docs/en/accessibility-semantics.md`, and any feature docs that describe the affected behavior |
| Installation, importmap, JavaScript entrypoints, packaging, or asset setup | `README.md`, `docs/ja/installation.md`, `docs/en/installation.md`, and `docs/ja/minimal-usage.md` / `docs/en/minimal-usage.md` when first-run examples change |
| Usage recommendations, decision guidance, or responsibility boundaries | `docs/ja/usage.md`, `docs/en/usage.md`, `docs/ja/decision-guide.md`, `docs/en/decision-guide.md`, plus related feature docs |
| Release policy, compatibility policy, migration guidance, or release checklist expectations | `docs/ja/release.md`, `docs/en/release.md`, this checklist, and `CHANGELOG.md` when the public surface changed |
| README-level positioning or top-level docs navigation | `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/ja/README.md`, and `docs/en/README.md` |

## CHANGELOG guidance

Update `CHANGELOG.md` when the change affects public behavior, public API, release policy, or user-visible documentation that should be called out for adopters.

Typical examples:

- new public helper, class, or documented option
- compatibility policy changes
- installation or packaging changes that affect adopters
- meaningful documentation additions that change how the gem should be integrated

Small typo fixes or local wording cleanups usually do not need a CHANGELOG entry.

## Root-level docs policy

Before adding a new root-level file under `docs/`, check whether it is really an entry point or maintenance asset.

Use a root-level doc only when at least one of these is true:

- it routes readers into both `docs/ja/` and `docs/en/`
- it serves as a cross-language maintenance checklist or project-wide policy note
- it is a technical asset index whose content is naturally language-light

Otherwise, prefer adding the prose doc under both `docs/ja/` and `docs/en/`.

## Release and PR review checklist

Before merging a doc-affecting PR or preparing a release, confirm:

- `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/ja/README.md`, and `docs/en/README.md` still point to the right entry docs
- Japanese and English docs are updated together when the change affects shared user-facing guidance
- public API changes updated both API docs and public API policy docs when needed
- manifest-backed public contract changes updated `config/public_api_manifest.yml`, both public API docs, and the related feature docs when needed
- compatibility, migration, or deprecation guidance updated both migration guides and release docs when needed
- accessibility changes updated both accessibility docs when needed
- installation or packaging changes updated README and installation docs when needed
- `CHANGELOG.md` was updated when the change materially affects adopters
- root-level docs were not added unless they meet the policy above

## Technical assets

`docs/mockups/README.md` is the source of truth for the current static mockup file inventory. Its Files table is also the source read by the browser smoke target list, so this checklist should describe responsibility rather than repeat every individual mockup HTML page. Browser smoke reads that table as the expected file list, then checks it against the separately maintained `focusedMockupSmokeTargets` array.

| Asset group | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/mockups/README.md` | Technical asset source of truth | Index for static mockup assets, focused subpages, shared CSS, review flow, and automated smoke coverage. Short bilingual-style prose is acceptable; no separate translation needed. |
| `docs/mockups/review-gallery.html` | Technical asset | Comparison hub for the current static mockup set. Keep it aligned with the README Files table and smoke coverage. No translation needed. |
| Top-level `docs/mockups/*.html` files listed in the mockup README | Technical assets | Individual static review references. Add, rename, or remove these through the mockup README and review gallery first so browser smoke coverage can detect drift. No translation needed. |
| Focused subpage assets linked from the mockup README, such as `docs/mockups/high-contrast-state-cues/index.html` | Technical assets | Keep subpages linked from the relevant README guidance rather than expanding this checklist into a second inventory. No translation needed. |
| `docs/mockups/default-tree.css` | Technical asset | Shared CSS for the static mockups. Keep CSS ownership in the mockup README and focused pages. No translation needed. |

## Ongoing maintenance

- Keep `docs/ja/` and `docs/en/` in sync for future user-facing changes.
- If a temporary mismatch is unavoidable, leave a visible note and plan the follow-up.
- Treat the High lane in the page-level coverage table above as the minimum same-sweep translation set promised by the language READMEs.
- When `docs/mockups/` gains, renames, or removes a focused reference page, update `docs/mockups/README.md` first, then keep `docs/mockups/review-gallery.html` and the browser smoke `focusedMockupSmokeTargets` coverage aligned with the current set.
- Update this technical-assets section only when the source-of-truth rule or asset-group responsibility changes, not for every individual mockup file addition.
- Prefer updating this checklist by replacement when the maintenance rule changes, instead of stacking stale release-specific notes on top of it.
